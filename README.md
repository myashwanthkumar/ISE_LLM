## For testing the features of the Applications
-  UserName:myash     Password : Ya#123
-  The above Profile has classes where the User is admin to one Course and student in another course.
-  Both have different functionalities according to their Roles.
-  The first time login might take some time due to the delays from the render when it is hit with first request. Subsequent actions will be good.
